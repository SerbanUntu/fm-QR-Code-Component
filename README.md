## My process

### Built with

- Plain ol' HTML and CSS

### What I learned

Getting things right to the smallest detail from a `.jpg` image is never that easy, no matter how apparently simple the project is.

It is crucial to standardize sizes for fonts, paddings and other elements, to keep the CSS from becoming too messy and hard to maintain.

### Continued development

I want to improve my knowledge of units in CSS an how to use them effectively, to keep my designs symmetrical and orderly.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Generator](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/) - I used this for working on the shadow of my card.
- [Emmet Tutorial](www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8vizNQKtx0) - I used Emmet to 10x my HTML writing speed
- Also, the Mozilla references for [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) are always useful.
